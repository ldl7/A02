##Git clone: It's like making a copy of someone else's project so you can work on it on your own computer without messing up the original
##Git branch: Imagine youre working on a bunch of different parts of your project at the same time. Branches act like separate folders that let you can work on different features without mixing up everything
##Git checkout: A command lets you switch between different branches, like flipping through different chapters of a book to find the one you need
##Git status: it just gives you an update as to whats changed/planned to happen. 
##Git add:  Adding files is like putting them in a box and getting them ready to be shipped off
##Git commit: you make a comment explaining what you did, then you use commit to save the change. 
##Git push: Commit saves the changes on your end, push sends those changes to the repository like github. 

##Source: friend explained the overall concept of each and I rephrased in my own words to make sure I understood each concept.
